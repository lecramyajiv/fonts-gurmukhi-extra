# Mukta

![Mukta](https://github.com/EkType/Mukta/blob/master/Promotion/banner.png "Mukta")

Mukta is a Unicode compliant, versatile, contemporary, humanist, mono-linear typeface available in seven weights, supporting Devanagari, Gujarati, Tamil and Latin scripts. 
This type family is a libre licensed version of Ek's self-titled multi-script project, an ongoing effort to develop a unified type family for each Indian script. 
The goal is to build one harmonious family across all Indian scripts without letting the visual features of one script dominate over others. 
This ensures that the fonts can be used successfully for both single and multi-script purposes. 
This project is led by [Ek Type](http://ektype.in), a collective of type designers based in Mumbai focused on designing contemporary Indian typefaces. 

At present the project offers separate fonts with unique local names for each of the Indian Scripts. 
Each font supports one Indian script along with Latin.

- Mukta for Devanagari

- Mukta Vaani for Gujarati

- Mukta Mahee for Gurmukhi

- Mukta Malar for Tamil

Mukta was designed by [Girish Dalvi](http://www.idc.iitb.ac.in/~girish) and [Yashodeep Gholap](http://www.yashodeepgholap.com). 
Mukta Vaani was designed by Noopur Datye and Pallavi Karambelkar with support from [Sarang Kulkarni](http://ektype.in) and [Maithili Shingre](http://ektype.in).
Mukta Malar was designed by Aadarsh Rajan. 
Mukta Mahee was designed by Shuchita Grover and Noopur Datye. 
We would like to thank Vinay Saynekar, Santosh Kshirsagar, Shubhanand Jog, Yogesh Jahargirdar, Pradnya Naik, Snehal Patil, Omkar Shende and Dave Crossland for their suggestions and feedback during the font design process. 
We would also like to thank faculty and friends from the Industrial Design Centre, IIT Bombay, and from Sir J J Institute of Applied Art, for their support and encouragement.

## Download TTF files

Binary TTF files are released at <https://github.com/EkType/Mukta/releases>

The font binaries are not directly part of this repository, as it only contains source files; 
however, the binaries are directly built from the ttx files in the `TTX` directory.

## How do I install the font on my computer?

First download the font binaries (TTF files) from the master branch, then follow the instructions given below.

- [GNU/Linux](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=how+to+install+fonts+in+linux)

- [Mac OS X](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2509)

## Getting Involved

Would you like to contribute to the development of this font? Here is how **you** can help:

1. Tell us about any bugs you find, or enhancements you would like to see

2. Contribute directly to the fonts. 
    In this repository we provide the complete set of source files that we use ourselves to develop the fonts. 
    If you with to contribute directly, please see below how we build the fonts and follow our build process, so that we can easily include your contribution. 
    Please follow the normal Github pull request process to send your contribution. 

### Bug Reports

Send us bug reports, feature enhancements or glyph requests, using the [Github Issue Tracker](https://github.com/EkMukta/Mukta/issues). 
Here are a few tips:

- Bugs must be isolated and reproducible problems that we can fix. 
    This means telling us step by step how we can produce the bug.

- Search for existing issues. We do not want duplicate issues, and you'll help us out a lot by first checking if someone else has reported the same issue. 

- Share as much information as possible. 
    Include your operating system and its version, what application(s) you found the problem with and their version, etc. 

## Building the font from source
   
This requires the following programs:

- **[Fontlab Studio](http://www.fontlab.com/font-editor/fontlab-studio/):** `.vfb` design files are used by this font editor, for Windows and Mac from the Fontlab company with a proprietary license and requiring a license fee from each user. 

- **[AFDKO](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko.html):** A set of command line tools for generating OpenType fonts from Adobe.

The build process used by Ek Type is as follows:

1. Make changes in FontLab `.vfb` file

2. Generate the `.ttf` file

3. Make changes in AFDKO feature files. 

4. Type the following commands in the Command prompt window. Make sure that the AFDKO directory is included in your path.

Use `maketof -h` to view the options available to you; 
choose the options you want as per your needs. 
To generate the release version of the font we generally use:

    makeotf -f Mukta-Regular-fl.ttf -o Mukta-Regular.ttf -r -S -rev
